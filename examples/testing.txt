Initialize server with virgin example localstate1:
	On deploy.imqs.co.za:
		sudo su testrsync
		cd ~
		rm -rf incoming
		mkdir incoming && mkdir incoming/channels && mkdir incoming/versions
		TODO: conf
	On local:
		upload-build.rb BinSrc=/cygdrive/c/dev/head/updater/examples/localstate1
		expected output:
			Some changes need to be made to 'versions'
			Detected completely new versions: 1, 2, 3
			WARNING: Unable to find an existing version to bootstrap from.
			Synchronizing versions
			Synchronizing channels

TODO: Then, testing deployment of that version
	(upload-build should trigger a "process-incoming" command on the server)
	(go run src/github.com/IMQS/updater/updater-cmd/main.go -config=examples\config-c-temp.json download)
	(go run src/github.com/IMQS/updater/updater-cmd/main.go -config=examples\config-c-temp.json apply)

Then, testing deployment of version 3:
	On local:
		upload-build.rb BinSrc=/cygdrive/c/dev/head/updater/examples/localstate2
		expected output:
			Some changes need to be made to 'versions'
			Detected completely new versions: 3
			Using version 2 to bootstrap new version 3
			Synchronizing versions
			Synchronizing channels

TODO: Then, testing deployment of that version
	(same as above)
